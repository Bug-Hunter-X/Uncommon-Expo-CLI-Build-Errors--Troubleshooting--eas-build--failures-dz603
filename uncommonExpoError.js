This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves issues with the `eas build` command or related processes.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, often just mentioning a general failure or an internal server error.  Debugging often involves checking various aspects of the project setup, the Expo CLI version, and the build service itself. The underlying cause might be related to issues with dependencies, incorrect configuration in `app.json` or `eas.json`, problems with the build server, or even temporary network connectivity problems.
